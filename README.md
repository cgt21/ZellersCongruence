# ZellersCongruence
With the use of Zeller's Congruence, we are able to calculate the specific day of the week of any date.

To use this java program, you must enter the date in the format of mmddyyyy. After doing this, the program will run and
it will return a numeric value, which is assigned to a specific day of the week.
